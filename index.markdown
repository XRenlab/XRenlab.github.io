The Tenth International Symposium of Chinese CHI (Chinese CHI 2022, jointly with the International Workshop on Human-Engaged Computing) will be structured as a Hybrid-Onsite conference from November 5–6 in Guangzhou, China. Supported by the International Chinese Association of Computer Human Interaction (ICACHI), Chinese CHI is steered by a group of globally distributed HCI researchers, practitioners, academics, and students concerning about the development of HCI as a thriving field in the global Chinese communities. Chinese CHI serves as a primary forum for connecting the international HCI community to the booming Chinese computing industry.

The theme of Chinese CHI 2022 is Inclusion, Resilience, and New Normal. We welcome discussions on the value, significance, and social contribution of human-computer interaction in the context of the post-pandemic era. We plan to have all accepted papers included in the conference proceedings and published through the ACM Digital Library and EI Compendex.

本届 Chinese CHI 2022会议以后疫情时代下的包容，韧性，新常态为主题。会议将于2022年11月5至6日在中国广州召开，采取线上线下同步方式进行。由世界华人华侨人机交互协会（ICACHI）举办的这一学术会议已日益成为连接世界范围内的华人HCI学者、学术界和产业界的重要会议。从2012年起，Chinese CHI已分别在巴黎、多伦多、首尔、硅谷、中国广州、加拿大蒙特利尔、中国厦门及线上成功举办九届。历届会议发表论文均会收录于ACM Digital Library，并提交EI检索。
